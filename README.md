This is a solid React + Typescript Boilerplate, using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), with [`CSS Modules`](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules), [`SASS`](https://sass-lang.com/) and traditional CSS stylesheets.

Support for [React-Router](https://reactrouter.com) and [Redux-Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) is on it's way!

This React App also uses a [webapck dashboard provided by FormidableLabs](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/webpack-dashboard), makes you feel like you work at NASA!
